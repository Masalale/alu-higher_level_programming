# Python - Classes

This repository contains my work with Python classes and OOP concepts.

## What's in here?

I've created a series of Python scripts that build on each other to demonstrate 
object-oriented programming principles. Each file adds new functionality to a 
Square class.

## Files

* `0-square.py` - Super simple empty class (starting point)
* `1-square.py` - Basic Square with private size attribute
* `2-square.py` - Added validation to make sure size is valid
* `3-square.py` - Added an area() method - now it does something useful!
* `4-square.py` - Getter/setter for size attribute (encapsulation)
* `5-square.py` - Added visual representation with my_print()
* `6-square.py` - Position attribute to control where the square appears
