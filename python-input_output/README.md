# Python - Input/Output

This repository contains my work with Python file I/O operations and JSON handling.

## What's in here?

I've created a series of Python scripts that demonstrate various file handling techniques, from basic file reading to JSON serialization and deserialization.

## Files

0-read_file.py - Function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout
1-write_file.py - Function that writes a string to a text file and returns the number of characters written
2-append_write.py - Function that appends a string at the end of a text file
3-to_json_string.py - Function that returns the JSON representation of an object
4-from_json_string.py - Function that returns an object represented by a JSON string
5-save_to_json_file.py - Function that writes an object to a text file using JSON representation
6-load_from_json_file.py - Function that creates an object from a JSON file
7-add_item.py - Script that adds all arguments to a Python list and saves them to a file
8-class_to_json.py - Function that returns dictionary description for JSON serialization
9-student.py - Class Student that defines a student with JSON serialization method
10-student.py - Extends Student class with filtered attribute serialization
11-student.py - Further extends Student class with reload from JSON capability
12-pascal_triangle.py - Function that returns Pascal's Triangle as a list of lists
