This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate the usage of imports and modules in Python programming.

## Files Description:

* `0-add.py` - Program that imports a function from another file and prints the result
* `1-calculation.py` - Program that imports functions from a file and performs multiple calculations
* `2-args.py` - Program that prints the number of and list of its arguments
* `3-infinite_add.py` - Program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments
* `4-hidden_discovery.py` - Program that prints all names defined by a compiled module
* `5-variable_load.py` - Program that imports a variable from a file

## Learning Objectives:
* How to import functions from another file
* How to use imported functions
* How to create a module
* How to use the built-in function dir()
* How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
* How to use command line arguments with your Python programs-+-+-+-+-+
